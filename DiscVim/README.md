# DiscVim

Version 0.1.1

Enjoy the beauty of finally navigating Discord with Vim motions. ðŸ¥‚

## MOTIVATION

- I have never created a Discord plugin or worked much with JavaScript. However, I absolutely love Vim motions and the idea of integrating them into Discord, which I use every day, would be an amazing challenge.
- **Massively** inspired by the [Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium). Full credit to them.

## GOALS

- This addon provides Vimium-like functionality, allowing users to navigate Discord with Vim motions similar to Vimium.

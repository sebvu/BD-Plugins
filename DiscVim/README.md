# DiscVim: Vim motions on Discord!

## MOTIVATION

- Never made a discord plugin ever or touched JS much at all. But, I absolutely love vim motions and the idea of integrating it on discord which I basically use everday (I have a life please üôè) would be an amazing task to tackle.
- **Massively** inspired by the [Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium) plugin. Full credits to them.

## GOALS

- This addon provides Vimium like functionality, being able to navigate discord with vim motions straight away.
- Provide easy customization options to personalize your usage.
